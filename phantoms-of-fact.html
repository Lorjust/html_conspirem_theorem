        <h2>Dyatlov Pass Incident</h2>
        <p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none">It was the year 1959, in the early days 
            of February. A group of Soviet ski hikers from Ural Polytechnical Institute went off on an excursion 
            to trek the Ural Mountains. The group consisted of ten people, eight men and two women, all ranging 
            from 21 to 24, with the exception of a 38-year-old sports instructor. The group was led by 23-year-old
            Igor Dyatlov. All of the hikers were well experienced, this hike aiming for a Grade III certification,
            which was the highest level of difficulty and achievement for non-alpine, long-distance treks. To 
            qualify, an expedition needed to be a minimum total distance of 300 kilometers (roughly 190 miles) 
            and be a duration of 16 days or more, and the group had to endure the natural climates and terrain of
            the mountains. This was the highest grade at the time, and the Dyatlov group was determined to earn 
            this.</span></p>
