        <h1>Moon landing Theories</h1>
        <p>The moon landing is widely regarded as one of humanity&rsquo;s greatest technological achievements. However, after the 1970s, doubts
            concerning the authenticity of the moon landing began to surface. The idea that the moon landing was a hoax is a classic conspiracy. Beleivers think 
            there is something fishy about the Apollo 11 landing on July 20, 1969. There are details of the landing that don&rsquo;t seem to 
            add up depsite what scientists and historians have to say.</p>
        
            <p>The first issue taken with the moon landing video is the flag that was planted was waving, which should not be possible in 
            a giant vacuum like space. The lighting of the video is also a point of contention, with the lighting being inconsistent, 
            suggesting it was filmed in a studio. The most prominent point I have heard is the fact that there were no stars, which further 
            supports the theory that it was filmed and staged. Conspiracists sometimes point to anomalies in the footage, claiming visible 
            inconsistencies, like the lack of a visible blast crater beneath the spacecraft or apparent motion discrepancies in the 
            astronauts&rsquo; movements.</p>
            
            <p>The reason it is easy to believe something like this is because many rightfully believe the government 
            will do anything to put themselves at an advantage. The most common arguement is that the United States faked the moon landing to win the Space Race 
            against the Soviet Union to boast technological superiority during the Cold War.</p>
