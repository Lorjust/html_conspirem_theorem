        <h1>Hollow Earth</h1>
        <p>Hollow Earth is an old theory that is parallel to the flat Earth conspiracies. Theorists part of this community believe that the Earth 
            is actually hollow, but what exactly lies within it varies. The list of beliefs goes as follows: an inner sun, an inner surface with 
            land and sky, advanced or ancient civilizations, prehistoric or giant creatures, large caverns, subterranean oceans and rivers, 
            tunnel networks, secret bases, non-human creatures, obscure libraries or spiritual centers, and a world of altered physics. There is 
            not exactly tangible proof that anything like this resides under the Earth, but the appeal to something like this is that there is 
            not a concrete way to prove any of these theories wrong since we cannot delve into the depths of the planet ourselves.</p>

            <p>The concept of a hollow Earth dates back several centuries, with early philosophical musings appearing in the works of
            Edmond Halley, the 17th-century astronomer known for Halley&rsquo;s Comet. He thought Earth was composed of inhabited concentric shells
            that could explain anomalous compass readings and magnetic phenomena at the time in 1692.A more dramatic version of the theory gained 
            popularity in the 19th century when John Cleves Symmes Jr. claimed that entry to the interior Earth was possible through massive openings 
            at the North and South Poles. He even campaigned for expiditions to take place.</p>

            <h2>Beliefs</h2>
            
            <p>Theorists beleive in Geophysical Hollow Earth, which is the idea that Earth is hollow inside containing low gravity hidden lands, civilizations,
            or even a miniature sun, taht can only be accessed through polar openings. These polar openings are inspired by Symmes' theory and are even connected
            to the stories of atlantis. Many picture inside to be full of alien or prehistoric life and even UFO and Nazis bases. A big theory to mention is the 
            existence of The Kingdom of Agartha. Its described as a utopian paradise untouched by surface humanity's problems. Its inhabitants are thought to 
            possess telepathic abilities and profound spiritual wisdom along with a long life span. Possible entrances to Agartha include Mount Shasta in California, 
            the Giza Pyramid in Egypt, caves in South America, and the Himalayas. Shambhala is a similar kingdom seen as the rival power to Agartha. The orgins of 
            Agartha and Shambhala did not initially involve hollow Earth, evolution of stories passed down began to merge the concepts together.</p>

            <p>As mentioned before, there is belief of a hidden sun, altered gravity, and secret bases but there are other interesting theories as to what lies
            under us. There are talk of esoteric libraires and sources of knowledge like hidden masters and spiritual training centers.
            Non-human creatures like dwarves, reptiles, angels, and demons are also said to be burrowed under the crust. As 
            for the terrain, inner Earth is said to have its own sky and subterranean oceans and rivers, as well as gaurded tunnel networks to get
            from place to place underground. There is still much unknown about what really lies inside hollow Earth, but it is unlikely we will have answers anytime soon.</p>
