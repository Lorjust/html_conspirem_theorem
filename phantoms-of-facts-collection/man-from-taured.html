        <h1>Man From Taured</h1>
        <p>This conspiracy&rsquo;s origin began at Haneda Airport in Tokyo in July 1954. A man walked in who seemed to be a well-dressed European 
            man. He spoke several languages, including Japanese, and appeared to be a business traveler. When presenting his passport, immigration 
            officials were perplexed when he presented a passport from a country that did not exist. It appeared to be made in a country called
             &ldquo;Tarued&rdquo; that sat between Spain and France. Immigration officials rightfully pulled him aside to sort the situation out, 
             but this only agitated the mysterious man as he insisted that Tarued was a valid country that had been around for over 1,000 years. 
             The man presented his driver&rsquo;s license, passport, checkbook, and working documents. He was on a business trip fromTaured to a 
             sister company in Japan and presented such. However, all of his documents seemed to have come from this unknown country. The man was 
             shortly detained so the issue could be solved the next day. He was held in a nearby hotel that was being heavily guarded. The next 
             morning, when officials came to collect him for questioning, they found an empty hotel room. His possessions, documents, and any trace
            of him just disappeared. It is unknown how he escaped, given his room was multiple stories above the ground and was being guarded. So 
            where did he go? Well, there are theories, but nothing absolute.</p>
            <p>The biggest theory seems to be that the mystery man was a time traveler. When presenting documentation, the man presented work documents 
                for a company that actually did exist and that looked official. However, when officials called the corporation, they had no knowledge of 
                the man from Taured. Additionally, his driver&rsquo;s license had legitimate, official seals, the standard format for licenses at the time. 
                Lastly, and the most curious of them all, his passport. The man&rsquo;s passport had entry and exit stamps from various European airports, 
                suggesting it had been used in other countries, including prior visits to Japan. Due to these circumstances, many theorize that he may have 
                been a skilled con artist or that he accidentally slipped through a wormhole or time-traveled. His being a skilled con artist does make more 
                logical sense but leaves the question of how he escaped without being seen; however, the theory of time travel is completely out there. It is 
                believed the man may have accidentally entered our timeline, where Taured did not exist, but instead a currently existing country, Andorra, 
                took its place. The reason he disappeared is that the universe, or the man himself, realized he was not supposed to be there or made a mistake 
                in his destination. The time travel theory supposes that in the future, humans have figured out a way to travel into the past. However, just 
                like the other conspiracies, there is no definitive conclusion as to what happened.</p>
