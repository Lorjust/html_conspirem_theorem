        <h1>Bermuda Triangle</h1>
        <p>The Bermuda Triangle is a very well-known and&nbsp;notorious mystery that holds many peculiar disappearances. There have been notable 
            plane and ship disappearances from 1918 to the 1980s. The first documented instance of the Bermuda Triangle claiming a vessel is in 
            1918, when the USS Cyclops, a Navy ship carrying a crew of 309, was traveling from Barbados to Baltimore and disappeared without 
            sending a distress signal. This was the largest non-combat loss in U.S. Navy history, and there was no wreckage recovered from the 
            search. The most famous disappearance was Flight 19 in 1945, where five U.S. Navy torpedo bombers went on a training mission from 
            Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The pilots radioed that they were lost and disoriented. The squadron never returned.A rescue plane, a PBM 
            Mariner, was sent to search for the vessel, but it also disappeared. No wreckage from Flight 19 or the Mariner was ever found. Later, 
            there was a report from a tanker cruising off the coast of Florida of a visible explosion seen at 7:50 p.m. It is unclear whether the 
            explosion and the disappearances of the 27 men were related, but the sighting did not leave much hope. Many disappearances follow the 
            pattern of not leaving any trace. Other notable mysteries include the disappearances of the SS Cotopaxi, Star Tiger, DC-3 Flight 
            NC16002, Star Ariel, and many others. As of September 2025, there have not been any notable disappearances or crashes involving the 
            Bermuda Triangle.</p>
